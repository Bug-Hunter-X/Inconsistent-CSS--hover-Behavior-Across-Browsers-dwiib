The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the expected behavior of the `:hover` pseudo-class is not consistent across different browsers.  The background color change on hover should smoothly transition, but in some browsers, it might appear abruptly or not at all.

```css
.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  transition: background-color 0.3s ease;
}

.box:hover {
  background-color: #007bff;
}
```
